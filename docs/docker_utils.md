# Docs for docker-utils.go

## Usage

The `docker-utils.go` file in the `utils` package provides a function to check if the current environment is running inside a Docker container. This can be particularly useful for applications that need to adjust their behavior based on whether they are running in a containerized environment.

## IsRunningInDocker

### Description
`IsRunningInDocker` checks various indicators to determine if the current process is running inside a Docker container.

### Usage
```go
runningInDocker := IsRunningInDocker()
```

### Reference
This function does not take any parameters and returns a boolean value:

| Return Value | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| runningInDocker | `bool` | Returns `true` if the current process is detected to be running inside a Docker container, otherwise `false`. |

### Detection Mechanism
1. Checks for Docker-specific environment variables like `REMOTE_CONTAINERS_IPC`, `REMOTE_CONTAINERS_SOCKETS`, `REMOTE_CONTAINERS_DISPLAY_SOCK`, and `REMOTE_CONTAINERS`.
2. Looks for the presence of the `/.dockerenv` file.
3. Reads the `/proc/1/cgroup` file to check for the `docker` keyword, indicating that the process is running inside a Docker cgroup.

This utility function is essential for applications that need to dynamically identify their running environment, especially when differentiating between containerized and non-containerized contexts.
